# Text summarization with BERT using bert-extractive-summarizer

This repo is the generalization of the lecture-summarizer repo. This tool utilizes the HuggingFace Pytorch transformers library to run extractive summarizations. This works by first embedding the sentences, then running a clustering algorithm, finding the sentences that are closest to the cluster's centroids. This library also uses coreference techniques, utilizing the https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref library to resolve words in summaries that need more context. The greedyness of the neuralcoref library can be tweaked in the CoreferenceHandler class.
